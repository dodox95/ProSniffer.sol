ProSniffer is a decentralized smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging Solidity 0.8.20. Designed with security in mind, it integrates features like SafeMath to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows. This contract adheres to the ERC20 token standard, providing typical functionalities like transfers, approvals, and balance inquiries. Unique attributes include dynamic buy and sell tax rates that adjust based on specific conditions, as well as a mechanism to swap tokens for Ether directly on the Uniswap V2 Router. An "Ownable" trait ensures that specific administrative functionalities, like changing tax rates or recovering tokens, are restricted to the contract's owner. Additionally, the ProSniffer contract has been designed with considerations for trading restrictions and ownership renouncements.
